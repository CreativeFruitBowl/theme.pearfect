/**
 * [CSS Reset] Sanitize.css: Accessibility: Reduce motion media query
 *
 * sanitize.css is a CSS library that provides consistent, cross-browser 
 * default styling of HTML elements alongside useful defaults.
 *
 * sanitize.css is developed alongside normalize.css, which means every 
 * normalization is included, and every normalization and opinion are 
 * clearly marked and documented.
 * 
 * sanitize.css wraps styles in zero-specificity selectors using :where().
